ABSTRACT :
The accurate prediction of stock prices is a crucial factor in the financial industry, with significant implications for investment decision-making and risk management. This research investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms in predicting stock prices by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis. The study utilizes a large dataset of historical stock market data, encompassing multiple features such as price, volume, and technical indicators.

The research compares the performance of several widely-used machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). These models are systematically evaluated based on their predictive accuracy, generalizability, and computational efficiency. Additionally, the study explores the impact of feature selection, data pre processing techniques, and hyperparameter tuning on the predictive performance of the models.

The findings of this research not only shed light on the strengths and limitations of each machine learning algorithm in the context of stock price prediction, but also provide valuable insights into the optimal configurations and pre processing methods for improved performance. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential of combining different algorithms in ensemble models to achieve superior accuracy and robustness. Ultimately, the research underscores the importance of leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to support financial professionals in making informed investment decisions and managing market risks effectively.
